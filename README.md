# jasmine-unit_tests
testing out jasmine framework v2.4.1

This uses the default with the player and music tests. Additionally I've added the introductions.js file.

Pending tests (unfinished tests) are called using xit. Also there are 3 manual fail specs that read in the console.error if you open inspect the window.
